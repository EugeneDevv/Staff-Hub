# Node / React Starter

This is a fullstack web application starter leveraging a React SPA in front of an Express REST API, with a Postgres database.

## Getting Started

The recommended approach for running the application locally is to use the provided devcontainer. This ensures you have the appropriate node version, and handles starting a local database. 
This approach requires the following local dependencies:

- Git
- Docker
- SSH keys configured with GitHub
- A devcontainer compatible editor
  - VS Code is strongly recommended; The repo also contains debugging configurations for VS Code

## Contributing

Contributions should always be made in a topical branch and PR'd back into `main`.
